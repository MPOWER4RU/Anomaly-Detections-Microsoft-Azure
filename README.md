# Anomaly Detection in Web Server Logs

## Description
ThirdEyeâ€™s one-click deployable solution for Outlier Detection in web server logs is generally available on the Microsoft Azure cloud. The solution works off the web server logs, parses and processes it to get it ready to generate actionable insights. 
<br/><br/>
The solution does the following activities on the web server logs:
* Persist on the Azure Blob Storage.
* Leverage Azure Data Factory for orchestrating the whole end-to-end data processing pipeline.
* Get the data ready at the end of the pipeline, using interactive PowerBI dashboards.
<br/><br/>
Outlier Detections modules are inbuilt into the solution, and default machine learning models ready to be used. The data pipeline supports both cold path and hot paths, thereby enabling both batch and real-time analytics. The solution is completely deployable on the Microsoft Azure cloud in less than 15 minutes by clicking on one button. All required components of the solution are automatically created, initiated and populated with custom data as per the end-users requirements. Further customizations could take additional time.
